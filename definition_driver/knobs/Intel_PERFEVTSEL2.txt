Performance Event Select Register 2, [0:7] Event Select: Selects a performance event logic unit. [15:8] UMask: Qualifies the microarchitectural condition to detect on the selected event logic. [16] USR: Counts while in privilege level is not ring 0. [17] OS: Counts while in privilege level is ring 0. [18] Edge: Enables edge detection if set. [19] PC: enables pin control. [20] INT: enables interrupt on counter overflow. [21] AnyThread: When set to 1, it enables counting the associated event conditions occurring across all logical processors sharing a processor core. When set to 0, the counter only increments the associated event conditions occurring in the logical processor which programmed the MSR. [22] EN: enables the corresponding performance counter to commence counting when this bit is set. [23] INV: invert the CMASK. [31:24] CMASK: When CMASK is not zero, the corresponding performance counter increments each cycle if the event count is greater than or equal to the CMASK.
