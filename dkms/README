Convert x86_adapt kernel modules to dkms folders

Howto:

1. Build kernel sources and DKMS packages

$ # go to this folder
$ cd dkms
$ # create folders
$ ./make_dkms.sh

Now make sure, that the x86_adapt* folders are owned by root and that no one else has any access rights!

2. install dkms folders

$ # go to this folder
$ cd dkms
$ # install modules
$ ./make_install.sh

3. Uninstall from dkms

$ # go to this folder
$ cd dkms
$ # install modules
$ ./make_remove.sh

Note: you might want to edit the version of the dkms packages in the scripts
